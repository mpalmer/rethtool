# A (very) partial implementation of the functionality available in ethtool
# (and the associated ioctl interface) in pure Ruby.
#
# Why?  Because I like to do crazy things.
#
# All the functionality you're likely to actually want is in subclasses of
# Rethtool itself:
#
#  Rethtool::InterfaceSettings
#    Get the settings (speed, duplex, etc) of an interface
#
#  Rethtool::LinkStatus
#    Whether the link is up or down
#
class Rethtool

	SIOCETHTOOL = 0x8946

	# From /u/i/linux/ethtool.h

	ETHTOOL_CMD_GSET  = 0x00000001
	ETHTOOL_CMD_GDRVINFO  = 0x00000003

		# Issue an SIOCETHTOOL ioctl.  ecmd must respond to #data (such

		# unserialized and returned.  The data you pass in WILL NOT be
